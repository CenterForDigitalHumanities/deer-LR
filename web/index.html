                Saint Louis was a major hot spot during the Civil War in terms of battles, skirmishes, arsenals, prisons and 
                encampments.  With all of the sources related to the Civil War in St. Louis and Missouri, no comprehensive 
                effort has been made to identify and map likely locations of ordnance and/or archaeological remains.  This 
                project performs a public service by assisting the local FBI branch in producing such a map for both their 
                use and public use.
